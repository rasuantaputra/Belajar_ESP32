Generic Attributes (GATT) = it defines an hierarchical data structure that is exposed to connected BLE devices.

-(BLE Service)-
* Profile = which is composed of one or more services
* Services = is simply a collection of information (Every service contains at least one characteristic, like sensor readings, for example)

-(BLE Characteristic)-
* The characteristic is always owned by a service, and it is where the actual data is contained in the hierarchy (value)
* The characteristic always has two attributes:
	- characteristic declaration (that provides metadata about the data)
	- characteristic value (the characteristic value can be followed by descriptors, which further expand on the metadata contained in the characteristic declaration.)
* Properties = describe how the characteristic value can be interacted with .Basically, it contains the operations and procedures that can be used with the characteristic:
	- Broadcast
	- Read
	- Write without response
	- Write
	- Notify
	- Indicate
	- Authenticated Signed Writes
	- Extended Properties
* UUID = is a unique 128-bit (16 bytes) number (Each service, characteristic and descriptor have an UUID (Universally Unique Identifier))
		 In summary, the UUID is used for uniquely identifying information. For example, it can identify a particular service provided by a Bluetooth device.

-(Pseudo For creating a BLE server)-
1. Create a BLE Server. In this case, the ESP32 acts as a BLE server.
2. Create a BLE Service.
3. Create a BLE Characteristic on the Service.
4. Create a BLE Descriptor on the Characteristic.
5. Start the Service.
6. Start advertising, so it can be found by other devices.
